# Data Science Projects

Welcome to my Data Science Projects repository! This repository contains various Jupyter Notebook files showcasing different data science projects and analyses.

## Projects Included

- **Asteroid Hazard Prediction**: A project focused on predicting potentially hazardous asteroids using machine learning techniques.
- **CalCOFI Oceanographic Analysis**: A project analyzing long-term oceanographic data to predict water temperature based on salinity using regression techniques.
- **Diabetes prediciton system with KNN Algorithm**: A diabetes prediction project that uses the KNN algorithm to assess health data and identify individuals at risk, while uncovering key factors influencing diabetes.
- **Food Delivery Time Prediciton using Decision Tree Regressor**: A Python project that predicts food delivery time using a Decision Tree Regressor based on driver age, ratings, and delivery distance.
- **Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Imbalanced Dataset**: A project aimed at identifying fraudulent transactions through advanced machine learning techniques, utilizing algorithms such as Random Forest and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address class imbalance in the dataset. The model focuses on maximizing recall to ensure high detection rates of fraudulent activities while minimizing false positives, enhancing financial security for users.
- **Exploring Musical Characteristics: K-Means Clustering of Popular Songs**: A K-Means clustering analysis of the top 953 streamed songs, highlighting patterns in musical characteristics and their relationship to streaming numbers.
- **Liver Disease Prediction using 7 different models**: A Jupyter Notebook project implementing seven machine learning models to predict liver disease, including data preprocessing, model comparison, and performance evaluation.
- **Grade Prediction using AdaBoost Regressor**: Contains a comprehensive analysis of student performance, demonstrating the use of regression models to predict grades based on various influencing factors, with an emphasis on model evaluation and performance metrics.
- **Text summarization using NLP**: This project is about taking a text and generating a summary using libraries such as NLTK and SpaCy. I created a pipeline that preprocesses the input text, identifies key sentences to produce a concise and coherent summary, enhancing information retrieval and understanding.
- **Summer Olympics Data Analysis:** An exploratory data analysis of Summer Olympics history (1896-2016) examining athlete demographics, medal distributions, and performance trends across nations. The analysis reveals fascinating insights about Team USA's dominance, gender participation evolution, and age distribution patterns of Olympic athletes through interactive visualizations using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Plotly.
- **Wine EDA**: A machine learning project analyzing red wine quality using various features like acidity, pH, and alcohol content through comprehensive exploratory data analysis and stratified sampling techniques. The analysis includes data visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib, focusing on feature distributions and quality correlations to prepare for predictive modeling.
