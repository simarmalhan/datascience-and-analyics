# Data Science Projects

Welcome to my Data Science Projects repository! This repository contains various Jupyter Notebook files showcasing different data science projects and analyses.

## Projects Included

- **Asteroid Hazard Prediction**: A project focused on predicting potentially hazardous asteroids using machine learning techniques.
- **CalCOFI Oceanographic Analysis**: A project analyzing long-term oceanographic data to predict water temperature based on salinity using regression techniques.
- **Diabetes prediciton system with KNN Algorithm**: A diabetes prediction project that uses the KNN algorithm to assess health data and identify individuals at risk, while uncovering key factors influencing diabetes.
- **Food Delivery Time Prediciton using Decision Tree Regressor**: A Python project that predicts food delivery time using a Decision Tree Regressor based on driver age, ratings, and delivery distance.
- **Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Imbalanced Dataset**: A project aimed at identifying fraudulent transactions through advanced machine learning techniques, utilizing algorithms such as Random Forest and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address class imbalance in the dataset. The model focuses on maximizing recall to ensure high detection rates of fraudulent activities while minimizing false positives, enhancing financial security for users.
- **Exploring Musical Characteristics: K-Means Clustering of Popular Songs**: A K-Means clustering analysis of the top 953 streamed songs, highlighting patterns in musical characteristics and their relationship to streaming numbers.
- **Liver Disease Prediction using 7 different models**: A Jupyter Notebook project implementing seven machine learning models to predict liver disease, including data preprocessing, model comparison, and performance evaluation.
- **Grade Prediction using AdaBoost Regressor**: Contains a comprehensive analysis of student performance, demonstrating the use of regression models to predict grades based on various influencing factors, with an emphasis on model evaluation and performance metrics.
